Inspired by ChrisBane's [**tivi**](https://github.com/chrisbanes/tivi/) project, Observable Loader exposes a `flow` of type `boolean` which returns `true` when the count is greater than 0.
It consists of a `start` function which increments the counter and `stop` function which decrements the counter.
