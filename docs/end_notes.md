## Contribution Guidelines:

There are no special rules for contributing your expertise and making the open-source community more powerful. Just don't forget to file an issue or start a discussion so that I may not be surprised when you create a pull request. Running `spotlessApply` before creating a pull request would be the cherry on the cake.
