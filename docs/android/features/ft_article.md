## Overview

- Users can search for articles and filter them according to their favorite author or any topic they like.
- Custom Implementation:
    - **Implemented custom pagination system.** It also supports recovery from process death and is based on the Single Source of Truth principle. Everything, such as the page number, search query, and selected topic, will be restored after the process death from the cache.
    - **Article Detail Screen Supports Text Markdown** such as displaying quotes, code blocks, and many more.
- Daily Read Reminder notification and widget:
    - Users get a notification to read an article every 24 hours.
    - If the user is authenticated and has subscribed to any topics of their choice, the server will pick a random article from their subscription.
    - If the user is unauthenticated, the server will pick any random article.
    - Article once shown for Daily Read would not be shown again (verified on the client-side).
    - The app's widget also displays the article selected for the Daily Read.
    - Clicking the Daily Read notification would open the respective article.
