## What's next ‚ú®

SlimeKT is a _Work In Progress_ project and there are several features/ideas which are yet to be implemented. You can help us in our journey by contributing your skills. Please don't forget to create a issue/feature request first or pick any existing one.

## Tech stack / Miscellaneous Features üöÄ
- Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, Flow, Accompanist, Navigation Component, Ktor (Android client), Room Database, Coil, Dagger Hilt, etc.

- **Material You:** The most exciting one.
